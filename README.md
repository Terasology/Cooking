Warning: You may want to bump up the max RAM usable by Terasology when enabling this module. Otherwise, your game might
crash when openining the Cooking section of the help menu.

## Contribution
1. Run `groovyw module recurse Cooking` command while in the Terasology root folder to fetch and store the module locally. Then fork the module and add a remote reference using the command `git remote add <remote-name> <your fork>` in the `/module/Cooking` directory.  
2. To **add a food item**, create a prefab similar to the ones [here](https://github.com/Terasology/Cooking/tree/master/assets/prefabs/food/raw).
3. While adding an icon for the food item, make sure that either you've created the textures for the new items, or the source you retrieved them from is compatible with the Apache 2.0 license. In any case cite the resources you've used in [this README file](https://github.com/Terasology/Cooking/blob/master/README.md).
4. Aim to keep the icons below 128x128 in resolution.
5. To **add a recipe**, create a prefab similar to the ones [here](https://github.com/Terasology/Cooking/tree/master/assets/prefabs/recipe/cook).
