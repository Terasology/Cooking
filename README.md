2. To **add a food item**, create a prefab similar to the ones [here](https://github.com/Terasology/Cooking/tree/master/assets/prefabs/food/raw).
3. While adding an icon for the food item, make sure that either you've created the textures for the new items, or the source you retrieved them from is compatible with the Apache 2.0 license.
